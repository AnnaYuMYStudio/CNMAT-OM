There is a very helpful set of tutorial patches from Jean Bresson's OpenMusic workshop that took place at CNMAT in Fall 2013.  Those patches are available here: http://repmus.ircam.fr/bresson/cnmat/om-workshop-2013

Additionally, there are example patches for the objects in the CNMAT-OMLib included as part of the download.
